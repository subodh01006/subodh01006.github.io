I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://cse.iith.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H)](https://iith.ac.in/), where I head the क्रम (Krama) Lab. My research interests are geometric machine learning (graph and point-cloud representation learning), optimal transport (discrete OT and assignment problems) and applied algebraic topology (topological data analysis). My work involves developing practical machine learning algorithms with rigorous theoretical foundations. 

Prior to my faculty position at IIT-H, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [DIMA](https://www.dima.tu-berlin.de/menue/database_systems_and_information_management_group/?no_cache=1), [Technische Universität (TU) Berlin, Germany](https://www.tu.berlin/en/), headed by [Prof. Volker Markl](https://www.bimos.tu-berlin.de/menue/bimos_people/members/professors/volker_markl/), investigating scalable machine learning methods, especially, locality sensitive hashing (LSH). Before that I was a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.au.dk/) at [Aarhus University, Denmark](https://international.au.dk/), where I was working on fast and approximate path-finding algorithms on massive 3D polyhedral meshes, under the guidance of [Prof. Christian S. Jensen.](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/christian-s-jensen) Prior to that, I was a Masters student and researcher in the [Uppsala database laboratory (UDBL)](http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/udbl/) headed by [Prof. Tore Risch](http://user.it.uu.se/~torer/) at the [Department of Information Technology](http://www.it.uu.se/?lang=en)  in [Uppsala University, Sweden](https://www.uu.se/en), where I investigated the near-future prediction of continuously evolving moving-object trajectories.   

Further information about how to join us at the क्रम (Krama) Lab can be found [here](https://T0kudai.github.io).
