I am an assistant professor in the <a href="https://cse.iith.ac.in/">Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)</a> at the <a href="https://iith.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H)</a>, where I head the <a href="https://T0kudai.github.io"> क्रम (Krama) Lab</a>. My research interests are geometric machine learning (graph and point-cloud representation learning), optimal transport (discrete OT and assignment problems) and applied algebraic topology (topological data analysis). My work involves developing practical machine learning algorithms with rigorous theoretical foundations. 
<br><br>
Prior to my faculty position at IIT-H, I was a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.dima.tu-berlin.de/menue/database_systems_and_information_management_group/?no_cache=1">DIMA</a>, <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/en/">Technische Universität (TU) Berlin, Germany, headed by <a href="https://www.bimos.tu-berlin.de/menue/bimos_people/members/professors/volker_markl/">Prof. Volker Markl</a>, investigating scalable machine learning methods, especially, locality sensitive hashing (LSH). Before that I was a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://cs.au.dk/">Computer Science Department</a> at <a href="https://international.au.dk/">Aarhus University, Denmark</a>, where I was working on fast and approximate path-finding algorithms on massive 3D polyhedral meshes, under the guidance of <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/christian-s-jensen">Prof. Christian S. Jensen.</a> Prior to that, I was a Masters student and researcher in the <a href="http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/udbl/">Uppsala database laboratory (UDBL)</a> headed by <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~torer/">Prof. Tore Risch</a> at the <a href="http://www.it.uu.se/?lang=en">Department of Information Technology</a>  in <a href="https://www.uu.se/en">Uppsala University, Sweden</a>, where I investigated the near-future prediction of continuously evolving moving-object trajectories.
