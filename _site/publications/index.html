It tries to find possible associations between items in large transaction based datasets. In order to create these associations, frequent patterns have to be generated.

A newly proposed in-memory distributed dataflow platform called Spark overcomes the disk I/O bottlenecks in MapReduce. Therefore, Spark presents an ideal platform for distributed Apriori.

Here, we propose a new approach which dramatically reduces this computational complexity by eliminating the candidate generation step and avoiding costly comparisons.

      <div class="hide" id="15" style="font-weight:bold">Different uses of a road network call for the consideration of different travel costs: in route planning, travel time and distance are typically considered, and green house gas (GHG) emissions are increasingly being considered. Further, costs such as travel time and GHG emissions are time-dependent and uncertain. To support such uses, we propose techniques that enable the construction of a multi-cost, time-dependent, uncertain graph (MTUG) model of a road network based on GPS data from vehicles that traversed the road network.

      <p>Different uses of a road network call for the consideration of different travel costs: in route planning, travel time and distance are typically considered, and green house gas (GHG) emissions are increasingly being considered. Further, costs such as travel time and GHG emissions are time-dependent and uncertain. To support such uses, we propose techniques that enable the construction of a multi-cost, time-dependent, uncertain graph (MTUG) model of a road network based on GPS data from vehicles that traversed the road network. Based on the MTUG, we define optimal routes that consider multiple costs and time-dependent uncertainty, and we propose efficient algorithms to retrieve optimal routes for a given source-destination pair and a start time.
