      <div class="hide" id="123"><br />The increased availability of massive point clouds coupled with their utility in a wide variety of applications such as robotics, shape synthesis, and self-driving cars has attracted increased attention from both industry and academia. Recently, deep neural networks operating on labeled point clouds have shown promising results on supervised learning tasks like classification and segmentation. However, supervised learning leads to the cumbersome task of annotating the point clouds. To combat this problem, we propose two novel self-supervised pre-training tasks that encode a hierarchical partitioning of the point clouds using a cover-tree, where point cloud subsets lie within balls of varying radii at each level of the cover-tree. Furthermore, our self-supervised learning network is restricted to pre-train on the support set (comprising of scarce training examples) used to train the downstream network in a few-shot learning (FSL) setting. Finally, the fully-trained self-supervised network’s point embeddings are used to initialize the downstream task’s network. We present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of our method on both downstream classification and segmentation tasks and show that supervised methods pre-trained with our self-supervised learning method significantly improve the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our method also outperforms previous unsupervised methods in downstream classification tasks.</div>

Although currently, several existing methods ’flatten’ such 3D images to use planar graph / hypergraph matching methods, they still suffer from severe distortions and other undesired artifacts, which result in inaccurate matching. Alternatively, current planar methods cannot be trivially extended to effectively match points on images warped onto manifolds. Hence, matching on these warped images persists as a formidable challenge. In this paper, we pose the assignment problem as finding a bijective map between two graph induced simplicial complexes, which are higher-order analogues of graphs. We propose a constrained quadratic assignment problem (QAP) that matches each p-skeleton of the simplicial complexes, iterating from the highest to the lowest dimension. The accuracy and robustness of our approach are illustrated on both synthetic and real-world spherical / warped (projected) images with known ground-truth correspondences.

      <p>Several state-of-the-art neural graph embedding methods are based on short random walks (stochastic processes) because of their ease of computation, simplicity in capturing complex local graph properties, scalability, and interpretibility. In this work, we are interested in studying how much a probabilistic bias in this stochastic process affects the quality of the nodes picked by the process. In particular, our biased walk, with a certain probability, favors movement towards nodes whose neighborhoods bear a structural resemblance to the current node’s neighborhood. We succinctly capture this neighborhood as a probability measure based on the spectrum of the node’s neighborhood subgraph represented as a normalized Laplacian matrix. We propose the use of a paragraph vector model with a novel Wasserstein regularization term. We empirically evaluate our approach against several state-of-the-art node embedding techniques on a wide variety of real-world datasets and demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves upon existing methods on both link prediction and node classification tasks.</p>

We conduct exhaustive empirical evaluations of our proposed method and show that it outperforms both the adaptation of state-of-the-art graph classification methods to few-shot scenario and our naive baseline GNNs.

For graph processing, rather than writing checkpoints that block downstream operators, our mechanism writes checkpoints in an unblocking manner that does not break pipelined tasks. In contrast to the conventional approach for unblocking checkpointing (e.g., that manage checkpoints independently for immutable datasets), we inject the checkpoints of mutable datasets into the iterative dataflow itself. Hence, our mechanism is iteration-aware by design. This simplifies the system architecture and facilitates coordinating checkpoint creation during iterative graph processing. Moreover, we are able to rapidly rebound, via confined recovery, by exploiting the fact that log files exist locally on healthy nodes and managing to avoid a complete recomputation from scratch. In addition, we propose replica recovery for machine learning algorithms, whereby we employ a broadcast variable that enables us to quickly recover without having to introduce any checkpoints. In order to evaluate our fault tolerance strategies, we conduct both a theoretical study and empirical experimental analyses using Apache Flink and discover that they outperform blocking checkpointing and complete recovery.</div>

      <div class="hide" id="10"><br />Digitally collected data suffers from many data quality issues, such as duplicate, incorrect, or incomplete data. A common approach for counteracting these issues is to formulate a set of data cleaning rules to identify and repair incorrect, duplicate and missing data. Data cleaning systems must be able to treat data quality rules holistically, to incorporate heterogeneous constraints within a single routine, and to automate data curation. We propose an approach to data cleaning based on statistical relational learning (SRL). We argue that a formalism - Markov logic - is a natural fit for modeling data quality rules. Our approach allows for the usage of probabilistic joint inference over interleaved data cleaning rules to improve data quality.

While many efficient single-machine methods for Apriori exist, the massive amount of data available these days is far beyond the capacity of a single machine.

A newly proposed in-memory distributed dataflow platform called Spark overcomes the disk I/O bottlenecks in MapReduce. Therefore, Spark presents an ideal platform for distributed Apriori.

It tries to find possible associations between items in large transaction based datasets. In order to create these associations, frequent patterns have to be generated. The Äpriori\"algorithm along with its set of improved variants, which were one of the earliest proposed frequent pattern generation algorithms still remain a preferred choice due to their ease of implementation and natural tendency to be parallelized.
<br>
While many efficient single-machine methods for Apriori exist, the massive amount of data available these days is far beyond the capacity of a single machine. Hence, there is a need to scale across multiple machines to meet the demands of this ever- growing data. MapReduce is a popular fault-tolerant framework for distributed applications. Nevertheless, heavy disk I/O at each MapReduce operation hinders the implementation of efficient iterative data mining algorithms, such as Apriori, on MapReduce platforms.
<br>
A newly proposed in-memory distributed dataflow platform called Spark overcomes the disk I/O bottlenecks in MapReduce. Therefore, Spark presents an ideal platform for distributed Apriori. However, in the implementation of Apriori, the most computationally expensive task is the generation of candidate sets having all possible pairs for singleton frequent items and comparing each pair with every transaction record. Here, we propose a new approach which dramatically reduces this computational complexity by eliminating the candidate generation step and avoiding costly comparisons.
<br>
We conduct in-depth experiments to gain insight into the effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of our approach. Our studies show that our approach outperforms the classical Apriori and state-of-the-art on Spark by many times for different datasets.</p>

      <p>This paper proposes a traffic shaping algorithm based on neural networks, which adapts to a network over which streaming video is being transmitted. The purpose of this intelligent shaper is to eradicate traffic congestion and improve end-user video quality. It posseses the capability to predict, to a very high level of accuracy, a state of congestion based upon the training data collected about the network’s behaviour.</p>
